           <b> Virginia Henderson Biography</b>
            <br>
            Virginia Henderson was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the daughter of Daniel Brosius Henderson and Lucy Minor Abbot. Named for the State her mother longed for, she returned there at age four and began her schooling at Bellevue, a preparatory school owned by "Grandfather", William Richardson Abbot. Her father was a former teacher at Bellevue and an Attorney who represented Native American Indians in disputes with the U.S. Government, winning a major case for the Klamath tribe in 1937. Her schooling was thorough but did not yield a diploma, a fact that delayed her entry into nursing school. Patriotic fervor stimulated her enlistment in the Army School of Nursing in Washington, D. C. where the students were treated like cadets in the U. S. Military Academy. Courses were taken at Teacher's College, Columbia University under the direction of her mentor, Miss Annie Goodrich. She graduated in 1921 and practiced nursing at the Henry Street Settlement in New York City.
She began her career as a nurse educator in 1924 at the Norfolk Protestant Hospital in Virginia where she was the first and only teacher in the school of nursing. After five years there she returned to New York to begin formal degree studies in nursing at Teacher's College. These were interrupted for a year when she practiced nursing at the outpatient clinics at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y., returning to complete her Bachelor's and Master's degrees with the aid of a Rockefeller Scholarship.
For the next sixteen years, she taught nursing at Teacher's College and practiced nursing at major New York teaching hospitals. Macmillan Publishing Company asked her to write a new (1939) fourth edition of the Harmer textbook which became a standard reference.
<br>
With royalties from the previous edition to support her, she took five years to completely revise the Harmer and Henderson Textbook of the Principles and Practice of Nursing for 1955 publication. The influence of nursing concepts from Nightingale's era that had buoyed the profession for over ninety years; cleanliness, nutrition, ventilation, order, etc., had outlived their usefulness with the advent of antibiotics and short hospital stays. The new edition of her text was organized around a view of nursing where:

"nurses assisted individuals, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health, its recovery (or to a peaceful death), that they would perform unaided if they had the requisite strength, will or knowledge."
This description of nursing concluded with the objective for giving nursing care; to help the individual be free of help as rapidly as possible. The textbook was used uniformly throughout hospital nursing schools in North America and served to standardize nursing practice.
The International Council of Nurses commissioned her to write an essay entitled Basic Principles of Nursing Care (Geneva, 1960) for the use of nurses who had neither access to technology nor the medical care required to establish disease diagnoses. The ICN publication is available in 29 languages and is in current use throughout the world.

Henderson's career in research began when she joined the Yale School of Nursing as Research Associate in 1953 to work on a critical review of nursing research. Her findings indicated that most nursing research studied nurses, not nursing care. A series of editorials she wrote for professional journals helped stimulate the reorientation of nursing research which became much more clinical.

Noting the absence of an organized literature upon which to base clinical studies, she embarked on a project to annotate nursing literature. The four volume Nursing Studies Index was completed in 1972 and was hailed as her most important contribution to nursing science.

<b>Florence Nightingale: Early Life</b>
<br>
Florence Nightingale was born on May 12, 1820, in Florence, Italy to Frances Nightingale and William Shore Nightingale. She was the younger of two children. Nightingale’s affluent British family belonged to elite social circles. Her mother, Frances, hailed from a family of merchants and took pride in socializing with people of prominent social standing. Despite her mother’s interest in social climbing, Florence herself was reportedly awkward in social situations. She preferred to avoid being the center of attention whenever possible. Strong-willed, Florence often butted heads with her mother, whom she viewed as overly controlling. Still, like many daughters, she was eager to please her mother. “I think I am got something more good-natured and complying,” Florence wrote in her own defense, concerning the mother-daughter relationship.
Florence’s father was William Shore Nightingale, a wealthy landowner who had inherited two estates—one at Lea Hurst, Derbyshire, and the other in Hampshire, Embley Park—when Florence was five years old. Florence was raised on the family estate at Lea Hurst, where her father provided her with a classical education, including studies in German, French and Italian.
From a very young age, Florence Nightingale was active in philanthropy, ministering to the ill and poor people in the village neighboring her family’s estate. By the time she was 16 years old, it was clear to her that nursing was her calling. She believed it to be her divine purpose.
When Nightingale approached her parents and told them about her ambitions to become a nurse, they were not pleased. In fact, her parents forbade her to pursue nursing. During the Victorian Era, a young lady of Nightingale’s social stature was expected to marry a man of means—not take up a job that was viewed as lowly menial labor by the upper social classes. 
When Nightingale was 17 years old, she refused a marriage proposal from a “suitable” gentleman, Richard Monckton Milnes. Nightingale explained her reason for turning him down, saying that while he stimulated her intellectually and romantically, her “moral…active nature…requires satisfaction, and that would not find it in this life.” Determined to pursue her true calling despite her parents’ objections, in 1844, Nightingale enrolled as a nursing student at the Lutheran Hospital of Pastor Fliedner in Kaiserwerth, Germany.
